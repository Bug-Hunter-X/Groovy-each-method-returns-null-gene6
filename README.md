This repository demonstrates a common unexpected behavior of Groovy's `each` method. The `each` method iterates over a collection and applies a closure to each element, but it doesn't return a transformed collection. This behavior differs from methods like `collect` which returns a new list containing the results of applying the closure to each element.  The example shows how to correctly use `collect` to achieve the desired outcome.
